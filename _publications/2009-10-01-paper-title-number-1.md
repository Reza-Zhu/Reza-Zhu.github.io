excerpt: 'The purpose of cross-view image matching is to match images acquired from the different platforms of the same target scene. With the rapid development of drone technology, how to help drone positioning or navigation through cross-view matching technology has become a challenging research topic. However, due to the existing public datasets don't include the differences in images obtained by drones at different heights, and the types of scenes are relatively homogeneous, which makes the models unable to adapt to complex and changing scenes. There is still potential to improve the accuracy of the models. We present a new cross-view dataset, SUES-200, to address these issues. SUES-200 contains images acquired by the drone at four flight heights and the corresponding satellite view images under the same target scene. To our knowledge, SUES-200 is the first dataset that considers the differences generated by aerial photography of drone at different flight heights. In addition, we build a pipeline for efficient training testing and evaluation of cross-view matching models. Then, we comprehensively analyze the performance of feature extractors with different CNN architectures on SUES-200 through an evaluation system for cross-view matching models and propose a robust baseline model on this dataset. The experimental results show that SUES-200 can help the model learn features with high discrimination at different heights.'
