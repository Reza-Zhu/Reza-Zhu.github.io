Research Statement
======
My work focuses on Computer Vision, Specifically, Cross-View Object Matching and Visual Geo-Localization.
I also interest in the AI application of GIS and Remote Sensing. Because our lab's
projects I had experience about Indoor Localization, Such as UWB, WiFi Localization.

News
======
I will graduate in 2023 Summer, So I am seeking a PhD or RA position in 2023 Fall.
